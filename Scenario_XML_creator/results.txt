Damn Vulnerable Web App (DVWA) 
Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA) is a PHP/MySQL web application that is damn vulnerable. Its main goal is to be an aid for security professionals to test their skills and tools in a legal environment, help web developers better understand the processes of securing web applications and to aid both students and teachers to learn about web application security in a controlled class room environment. The aim of DVWA is to **practice some of the most common web vulnerabilities**, with **various levels of difficulty**, with a simple straightforward interface. Please note, there are **both documented and undocumented vulnerabilities** with this software. This is intentional. You are encouraged to try and discover as many issues as possible.
